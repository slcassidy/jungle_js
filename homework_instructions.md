# Jungle JS (featuring Classes)

## Part 1: Use your knowledge of classes, inheritence, and the `new` keyword to create the structures necessary to match the conditions below...

1. A jungle contains several species of animals: tigers, monkeys and snakes.
2. All animals can do three things: make a sound, eat food, and sleep.
3. Each species of animal knows how many others of its kind exist (think global values)
4. By default when an animal's energy level changes, it changes in the following ways:
  a. -3 for making a sound
  b. +5 for eating food
  c. +10 for sleeping
5. The jungle can perform a sound off. This involves all of the animals in the jungle each making their sound, along with reporting their energy level.
6. Tigers get +5 energy for sleeping.
7. Monkeys get +2 energy for eating and -4 energy for making a sound.
8. Some animals have the ability to play.
9. Only monkeys can play. When they do they say "Oooo Oooo Oooo" and get -8 energy. If a monkey doesn't have enough energy to play they say "Monkey is too tired".
10. The jungle contains several types of food: meat, fish, bugs and grain.
11. Tigers can't eat grain because they have sensitive digestive systems.

## Part II: To test your Jungle, execute the following events:

1. Create three tigers. One tiger should go to sleep
2. Create an instance of bugs and grain
3. One tiger should eat the bugs and one tiger should eat the grain
4. Display the current tiger count using an existing tiger instances (tiger)
5. Diplay any tiger's energy level
6. Create a monkey
7. Display the current monkeyCount
8. Make the monkey sleep
9. Make the monkey play, until it's too tired
10. Create a snake
11. Add the 3 tigers, monkey, and snake to the jungle
12. Have the jungle sound off
